**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The DriverPass project was a system design project for the DriverPass company.  The company wanted to create a web application that would allow customers to schedule over the road training and take practice exams.  The owner of the business identified a niche market for this kind of thing, and it was my job to create a system design using the information provided from meeting with the customer.

**What did you do particularly well?**
I really think I did well with the UML activity diagrams.  They were intuitive for me to complete.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would revise my UML case document to include more functions and agents.  I only focused on one use case.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Ultimately, the customer is paying for the design.  It would be pointless to create an application that is not taking that into account.  The success of the project depends on me anticipating and answering the needs of the client.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I still prefer light pseudocode and creating an MVP as soon as possible.  Using prototypes to quickly get feedback to iterate on is the key to this.  Cumbersome system designs are often too bulky and inflexible.  After a while, they hardly ressemble the end product.  UML is not used much in industry.  One thing I can't deny though, is how powerful they are at showing technical information to business oriented people who aren't programmers.  I was actually in a meeting today where we were looking at a system and everyone was skeptical because the product owner failed to show any system designs.  This made the business stakeholders think the project was being mismanaged.
